Team byte-sized.  
The App folder contains our final project created using Django. 
The "index" html, css and js files contains a mockup of our app that runs in the Google Chrome browser (does not incorporate the machine learning aspect). 
Python open may fail when you run the manage.py out of the App package.

Using our web-based application, students will complete journal entries and fill out the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated screening tool for depression.
Our machine learning algorithm searches for words/phrases that are indicators of depression from patients journal entries and calculates the frequency of these words to formulate a quantitative framework for detecting mild, moderate and/or severe depression reported as a numerical score.
